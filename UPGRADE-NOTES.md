# Package Upgrade Notes

This document outlines the changes made to upgrade deprecated packages and improve the project structure.

## Package Updates

1. **Reorganized Dependencies**:

   - Added `remotePatterns` for better security with external images
   - Enabled experimental features like CSS optimization
   - Added package import optimization for smaller bundle sizes
   - Disabled the "Powered by Vercel" header for better white-labeling

2. **PostCSS Configuration**:
   - Migrated from CommonJS to ESM format (`postcss.config.js` â†’ `postcss.config.mjs`)

## Project Structure Improvements

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added `.env.example` with common environment variables
   - Added configuration for API endpoints and analytics

2. **Build and Development Tools**:
   - Added `.npmrc` for consistent package management

   - Created utility scripts for checking and updating packages
   - Added shell and batch scripts for cross-platform development

3. **Documentation**:

## How to Use the New Scripts

1. **Check for outdated packages**:
   ```bash
   npm run check-updates
   ```

2. **Update packages to their latest versions**:
   ```bash
   npm run update-packages
   ```

3. **Start development with package checking**:
   - On Unix/Linux/Mac: `./start-dev.sh`
   - On Windows: `start-dev.bat`

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Updates**: Run the check-updates script periodically to keep dependencies up to date
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for any performance regressions after updates
3. **Breaking Changes**: Be aware of major version updates that might introduce breaking changes
